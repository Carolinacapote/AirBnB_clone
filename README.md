# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Description

This repository contains the first steps of the AirBnB clone project made for Holberton School students.
During this first part of the project we had to::
- Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
